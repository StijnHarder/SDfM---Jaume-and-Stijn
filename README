# Systems Development for Marketing
This project aims to create Recomendation Systems usign diverse techniques applied in real life cases such as SVD and Collaborative Systems.

## Important Files

The important files in this project are listed below in chronological order:

1. `import_datasets`: file importation
2. `joining`: cleaning of the files and creatiopn of the cleaned parquets used in the EDA and Modelling.

### Movielens Dataset

For the Movielens dataset, the important files for the pre-processing part are:

1. `Movielens - Stratified sample`: creation of the stratified sample, significant for the modelling part since we are not going to be able to use the entire dataset.
2. `EDA Movielens - Full file`: [Description of the file]
3. `EDA Movielens - Stratified sample`: [Description of the file]

### Netflix Dataset

For the Netflix dataset, the important file for the pre-processing part is:

1. `EDA Netflix`: creation of the stratified sample, significant for the modelling part since we are not going to be able to use the entire dataset and EDA for the Netflix dataset.

## Models

The important files related to the models are:

### SVD (option A)

- `SVD modelling`

### Item KNN (option D)

For the Item KNN model, the important files are:

1. `Movielens - Item-based models - V2 - with Genres - optimized`
2. `Netflix - Item-based models - V2 - with Genres - optimized`
