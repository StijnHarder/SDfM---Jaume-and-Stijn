For this purpose, we are going to use `Stratified K-Fold` to ensure the sample is composed of the proper distribution of data."

    "### Explanation of Stratified Sampling Code for Movielens Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to create a stratified sample from the Movielens dataset based on the number of reviews for each movie. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count the Number of Reviews per Movie:\n",
    "The first step involves counting the number of reviews per movie in the dataset. This is achieved by creating a new column called num_reviews and populating it with the count of reviews for each movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Divide the Dataset into Strata:\n",
    "Next, the dataset is divided into strata based on the number of reviews. Quintiles are calculated to determine the boundaries for these strata, ensuring an equal distribution of data. These boundaries are adjusted for monotonic increase and assigned labels 'Q1' through 'Q5' to represent the five strata.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Categorize Movies into Strata:\n",
    "Movies are then categorized into these strata based on the number of reviews they have received. This is done by creating a new column named review_stratum, which assigns each movie to a specific stratum according to its number of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's delve into the code to see how these steps are implemented."
