    "### Compute similarity:\n",
    "Regularly, cosine similarity is often used to measure the similarity between users based on their preferences or ratings for items (in this case, movies). Cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 indicates perfect similarity,\n",
    "- 0 indicates no similarity, and\n",
    "- -1 indicates perfect dissimilarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Cosine Similarity**: Users are similar in their preferences or ratings for movies.\n",
    "- **Zero Cosine Similarity**: Users have no similarity in their preferences.\n",
    "- **Negative Cosine Similarity**: Users are dissimilar in their preferences, tending towards opposite ratings for movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implication:\n",
    "\n",
    "If one user likes certain types of movies, the other user tends to dislike them, or vice versa. In other words, users with negative cosine similarities have contrasting preferences, making them less suitable for recommending movies to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how similar users are we will compute the similarity between them. I will use cosine similarity as distance measure. The manhatten norm will be used to decrease computational weight instead of euclidian norm.\n",

    "\n",
    "This function calculates the cosine similarity matrix between users based on their ratings using the Manhattan norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thresholding**: First, the function applies thresholding to the user ratings matrix. Ratings below the threshold are set to 0, ensuring that only significant ratings are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dot Product Calculation**: It then computes the dot product of each pair of row vectors (users) in the thresholded matrix. This represents the similarity between users based on their common rated items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Norm Calculation**: Next, it calculates the norms (magnitude) of each row vector, considering only values above the threshold. This step prepares for the normalization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalization**: The dot products are divided by the norms of the corresponding row vectors, effectively normalizing the similarity values. This step ensures that users with a large number of ratings are not favored over users with fewer ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Setting Diagonal to 0**: Finally, the diagonal elements of the similarity matrix are set to 0 to avoid self-similarity, as a user's rating should not be compared to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of NumPy Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **np.dot**: Computes the dot product of arrays. Here, it calculates the dot product of the thresholded user ratings matrix with its transpose, resulting in the similarity matrix.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **np.where**: Returns indices where a condition is true. It's used here to apply thresholding to the user ratings matrix.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **np.sum**: Computes the sum of array elements. It calculates the norms of each row vector after thresholding, which are then used for normalization.\n",
    "  \n",
